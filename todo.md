V1. after x minutes (configurable in config.json) the /cloud page goes back to the main page. - V
V2. in addition to votes, we want to count how many times people voted in general (i.e. pressed submit) - V
V3. button text: change font to wordcloud font (in all langauges) - V
4. nice to have: possibly add svg's in addition to languages to the wordcloud idea. totally different thing though.
5. possibly add bg about the exhibition on the side(every astronaut can take 3 items to space, what would you choose?)
V6. possibly add a margin so there aren't words stuck one under the other one (configurable in config.json)
V7. make the arabic font bold (both in the wordcloud and in the button text) so it fits the other fonts more.
V8. reset selection after y minutes (configurable in config.json)
9. save the votes back to somewhere as backup every x days.
10. design work w nevo
11. lock fullscreen of browser unless you type escape or something. so kids won't exist the page.
